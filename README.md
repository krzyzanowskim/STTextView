# STTextView

The goal of this project is to build [NSTextView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextview) replacement component utilizing [TextKit 2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10061/). [because many good reasons](#-textkit-2-bug-reports-list).

The component is developed to serve [Swift Studio](https://swiftstudio.app) needs. (**ST** prefix stands for "**S**wift s**T**udio" because **[SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel)** is not good prefix since 1939)

[TextKit2](https://developer.apple.com/forums/tags/wwdc21-10061) was announced during [WWDC 2021](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10061/) as a TextKit replacement for text layout and whatnot. Apple announced that `NSTextView`, the view component specialized for text editing, will adopt TextKit2 and provide support along TextKit1 bits. As I started to learn more about `NSTextView` + TextKit2, I realized as of today (Feb 2022), neither NSTextView is fully functional, nor TextKit2 classes are fully functional. Along the way, I reported several bug reports to Apple requested DTS (support tickets). Eventually, I've got blocked by specific bugs that pushed me to start this project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

STTextView is distributed using the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). Install it in a project by adding it as a dependency in your `Package.swift` manifest or through ‚ÄúPackage Dependencies‚Äù in Xcode project settings

```swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/STTextView", from: "0.1.2")
    ]
)
```

## Usage

### Create a TextView

The STTextView is a subclass of NSView and as such can be initialized like any other view. It has an API that is similar to the one of NSTextView.

```swift
let textView = STTextView()
view.addSubView(textView)
```

```swift
let textView = STTextView()
let scrollView = NSScrollView()
scrollView.documentView = textView
```

### Customize

The text view can be customized in a variety of ways. 

```swift

let paragraph = NSParagraphStyle.default.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableParagraphStyle
// Set the line-height to 110%
paragraph.lineHeightMultiple = 1.1
paragraph.defaultTabInterval = 28

// Default Paragraph
textView.defaultParagraphStyle = paragraph

// Set default font
textView.font = NSFont.monospacedSystemFont(ofSize: 14, weight: .regular)

// Set default text color
textView.textColor = NSColor.textColor

// Set text value
textView.string = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean ornare lobortis sem a vulputate."
textView.addAttributes([.foregroundColor: NSColor.red], range: NSRange(location: 10, length: 5))

// Set wrapping
textView.widthTracksTextView = true

// Highlight the selected line.
textView.highlightSelectedLine = true
```

Add line numbers using specialized `STLineNumberRulerView` (specialized subclass of `NSRulerView`)

```swift
let textView = STTextView()
let scrollView = NSScrollView()
scrollView.documentView = textView

// Line numbers
let rulerView = STLineNumberRulerView(textView: textView)
// Configure the ruler view
rulerView.drawHighlightedRuler = true
// Set text color of the selected line number
rulerView.highlightLineNumberColor = .textColor

// Add to NSScrollView containing STTextView
scrollView.verticalRulerView = rulerView
scrollView.rulersVisible = true
```

Enable an optional search-and-replace find interface inside a view, usually a scroll view.

```swift
textView.textFinder.isIncrementalSearchingEnabled = true
textView.textFinder.incrementalSearchingShouldDimContentView = true
```

## üêõ TextKit 2 Bug Reports List

List of issues I reported to Apple so far:

- FB9856587: TextKit2 unexpected additional line fragment for last line
- FB9925766: NSTextSelectionNavigation.deletionRanges only works at the end of the word
- FB9925647: NSTextLayoutManager.replaceContents(in range: with attributedString:) is documented but is not part of the public API
- FB9907261: NSTextElementProvider.replaceContents(in:with:) does not replace content as documented
- FB9692714: Rendering attributes does not draw properly
- FB9886911: NSTextView can't properly layout and display long lines (this one is nasty since it causes the view "jump" whenever text attribute updates)
- FB9713415: NSTextView drawInsertionPoint(in:color:turnedOn) is never called
- FB9971054: NSLayoutManager.enumerateCaretOffsetsInLineFragment ignores starting location
- FB9971054: NSTextView assert on selection when setup with TextKit2
- FB9743449, FB10019859: NSTextContentStorage.textElements(for:) returns no element, while enumerateTextElements does return elements
- FB11898356: textSelections(interactingAt:inContainerAt:anchors:modifiers:selecting:bounds:) produces wrong selections for certain locations

... I'm aware that the list of issues is not complete.
